## Setup

For the project to be configured it is recommended to use the Eclipse IDE so that when opening the project the dependencies contained in the **pom.xml** file are automatically downloaded.

To execute the project, you must have installed JDK from version 8 onwards. And also the JRE version 1.8. 
You must also configure the MongoDB database with a connection string purchased from the following website:

[https://www.mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com)

With the connection string in hand just add to the **application.properties** file. You must also configure the email credentials that are in the same file.
